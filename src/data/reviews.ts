    text: "My history of buying property in Spain has been quite long. The first question was where to buy. First, we traveled to almost the entire coastline and met a dozen real estate agencies. Everyone had one song - only here, on the Costa Brava, only here, in Marbella, in Torrevieja, in Benidorm, etc. Quite by accident I ran into the Violet agency. That's when I got all the answers to my questions. Violetta told me about the pros and cons of each place. At the same time, I learned about what is not written about on the official sites. Only locals know this information. So, we have more or less sorted out the place. We liked the Costa del Sol. The next question is which house to choose? All the previous agents immediately took us to the objects, but in the end none of the proposed ones came up. ButVioletta asked about everything, how we will use it. The list was ready in a day. We started examining, asking questions and in the end we bought what we were looking for for so long! Moreover, it is even cheaper than planned!",

At first, a Moscow firm took up a lot of my time. It took a lot of money, but my question was not resolved. Then I had to move to Spain. There were a lot of problems with the purchase here. As a result, it turned out that I had not bought something that could help with a residence permit. I had to rebuild the business. Now I understand perfectly well that my mistake was to completely take everything into my own hands and refuse outside help. But that was wrong. In a foreign country, it was not possible to cope with such a task. He taxied, of course. This time I was helped by the real estate agency Violet",

He explained that demand has grown and the house is now not worth that much money. As a result, they left with nothing. But we should have been lucky! And a little later we found in the same place another, also quite good object. The Violet agency helped us with the design. A thousand words of gratitude to Violetta! We really enjoyed.

All my wishes were carefully listened to, and most importantly, the specialists relatively quickly (though not immediately) were able to find a house, which now I can confidently call the house of my dreams. I advise this agency to everyone who, although buying real estate in Spain, is not ready for various unpleasant surprises. Do not waste your time, but entrust the search for a dream home to a real professional with Violet agency!",
